This module enhances Odoo's accounting functionality by adding a dedicated menu item for accessing accounting ledgers.
It allows users to easily navigate and manage various ledgers, streamlining the tracking of financial transactions.
Additionally, the module modifies the accounting move line view to display the cumulated balance, offering deeper insights into account activities.

* General Ledger: Access the general ledger to view all financial transactions, including debits and credits.
* Ledger by Partner: View ledgers filtered by partner, allowing for more detailed analysis of transactions associated with specific customers or suppliers.
